# PyBer_Analysis

**Overview**

The purpose of this analysis was to take the information given to us from the csv files and manipulate the data to show us ride fare prices from each type of city, being either rural, suburban, or urban. We then created a line graph in jupyter notebook comparing these fare prices from each city over the course of four months to make a better representation of fare prices by each month. We did this by calculating average fare by each ride and average fare per driver for each city and then added this information to  a line graph for an easier analysis.

**Results**

After producing the analysis and creating the graph explaining ride fares by city type we can see that by average, Urban fares are starting at the highest price for all months across the data we collected. We then see that the average fares for suburban rides are second and the average fares for the rural cities are the cheapest. We can see from the graph that there is a small spike in ride fares right before march and then decreases again right before april. We can see that the ride fares for suburban and rural cities tend to be a bit more streamline whereas urban fares have a bit more variation in price especially during march to april months. 

**Summary**

Three disparities I could tell a CEO of a company is that rural areas have the cheapest ride fares while urban are most expensive and have most fluctuation of price during the spring months. Another disparity would be that rural areas also have kept the most stable ride fares throughtout the spring months.
