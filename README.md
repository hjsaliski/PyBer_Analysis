# PyBer_Analysis

**Overview**

The purpose of this analysis was to take the information given to us from the csv files and manipulate the data to show us ride fare prices from each type of city, being either rural, suburban, or urban. We then created a line graph in jupyter notebook comparing these fare prices from each city over the course of a year to make an easier analysis of fare prices by each month.
